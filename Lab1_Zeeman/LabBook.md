* **15:15** : Reading the labooks for the experiment and setting-up the github repository and planing our the working schedule.

* **14:15**: Going through the list of equipment. So far, it looks like we are missing:
-EQ3494
-EQ3497 shunt 0.01 ohm/30 amps UPDATE found it! it is on top of the power supply
-Transparent tape
-D shaped lens

* **14:45**: We are starting the calibration

* **15:10**: Uploaded the calibration ccv file for EQ3485 + plot

* **15:23**: Trying to measure residual magnetic field with the Hall probe HR-66 (EQ3485). Not exposed to magnetic field, the probe yields 0.7mV with Fluke 77 multimeter (see error) which via linear extrapolation yields a residual magnetic field of 9.73 ~ 10 G = 0.001Tesla. Is this Earth's Magnetic Field? (0.0025-0.0065 Teslas) or is it just a resdual electronic current?

* **15:58**: Calibration plot for the Hall Probe

* **16:02**: We are currently aligning the Hall probe in the middle of the electromagnet by looking at the voltmeter and finding the highest voltage read.
Everytime we come to the lab, we should be doing a calibration measurement so that we acquire as much data as possible

* **16:15**: We are measuring power supply voltage vs Hall probe voltage (all in mv). The power supply is measured with the multimeter Hitachi EQ1692 on the setting 200mv, and the Hall probe voltage is measured with the multimeter Fluke77 on the 300mv setting. We took increments of 2.5mv to see the behaviour. It seems pretty linear so far. Saved data in
