* **13:47**:Going through the material and the lab manual. We turn on the electronics and observe the oscilloscope to try and set things up for the calibration steps (no smaple).

* **14:44**: Turning on the Mausbauer driver and setting the source at oscillations. We get some sort of signal on the oscilloscope. We put the window knob at max and lower level knb at min on the AMP/TSCA apparatus.

* **15:23**: We set the AMP/TSCA coarse gain at 32. We put the crystalline iron foil in front of the detector to run a trial acquisition. After one minute, we do not see anything convincing. We'll try again with the stainless steel, which should produce peaks a bit faster. We are still not seeing things. We're probably triggering on noise.

* **15:29**: We changed the coarse gain to 8. Data acquisition is slower, but we're still seing noise. 

* **15:32**: we changed the window to 2.61, coarse gain to 32. We see peaks! Fafter three minutes, there is two small peaks around channel 130 and channel 383.

* **15:36**: We think our set up is now properly working. Note to future Antoine, futur Manuel and future P-A, don't change the set up unless told by professors.

* **15:38**: We started acquisition using iron. We expect to see 6 peaks forming rather rapidly. Leaving it there until friday.

* **13:41**: Came back to see the data from the calibration. We do see the peaks but they are doubled, since we are sweeping the speed in both sense. The data looks very good however.

* **13.50**: Starting the run for the Ferric fluoride sample.
