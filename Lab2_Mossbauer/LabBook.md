* **13:47**:Going through the material and the lab manual. We turn on the electronics and observe the oscilloscope to try and set things up for the calibration steps (no smaple).

* **14:44**: Turning on the Mausbauer driver and setting the source at oscillations. We get some sort of signal on the oscilloscope. We put the window knob at max and lower level knb at min on the AMP/TSCA apparatus.

* **15:23**: We set the AMP/TSCA coarse gain at 32. We put the crystalline iron foil in front of the detector to run a trial acquisition. After one minute, we do not see anything convincing. We'll try again with the stainless steel, which should produce peaks a bit faster. We are still not seeing things. We're probably triggering on noise.

* **15:29**: We changed the coarse gain to 8. Data acquisition is slower, but we're still seing noise. 

* **15:32**: we changed the window to 2.61, coarse gain to 32. We see peaks! Fafter three minutes, there is two small peaks around channel 130 and channel 383.

* **15:36**: We think our set up is now properly working. Note to future Antoine, futur Manuel and future P-A, don't change the set up unless told by professors.

* **15:38**: We started acquisition using iron. We expect to see 6 peaks forming rather rapidly. Leaving it there until friday.

* **13:41**: Came back to see the data from the calibration. We do see the peaks but they are doubled, since we are sweeping the speed in both sense. The data looks very good however.

* **13.50**: Starting the run for the Ferric fluoride sample.

__________

* **14:06**: Stopping the run for the [ferric fluoride](https://github.com/antoinebelley/Phys_359/blob/master/Lab2_Mossbauer/ferricfluoride.txt) sample. Seem that we have a low count number. We decided to bring the source closer to get higher level of couts.

* **14:20**: Starting analysis of the calibration data. We fit some Lorentzian and get the peak values. Then from a MIT paper we find the energy transitions of Fe 57. Good explanation on how to do can be found in [Caltech lab manual](http://www.sophphx.caltech.edu/Physics_7/Experiment_29.pdf). The real value of the lines in velocity are found [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1659777?class=pdf).

* **15:59**: Started the mica run.

__________

* **14:15**: Stopping the [mica run](https://github.com/antoinebelley/Phys_359/blob/master/Lab2_Mossbauer/mica0212.txt).
* **14:30**: Starting measurement with the stainless steel foil.
* **15:26**: Ending measurement with stainless steel foil.
* **15:27**: Placing in the mica plate. We are doing it first run for the plate vertically placed. I.e no angle.

* **13:10**: Stopping the  first run for the plate vertically placed. I.e no angle.
* **13:11**: Starting measurement with the mica plate oblique.


17/02/2020
__________

* **13:45**: Stopping the with the mica plate oblique.
* **14:00**: Preparing the ferric amonium liquid sample. We measured 80.3 pm 0.1 mg of powder using Robert's scale. 
* **14:13**: Filling the holder with water to determine volume. We measured 3.8 pm 0.1 ml using the seringe. Making a solution with 3.8 ml and 80.3 mg to put in the holder.
* **14:16**: Placing the liquid sample in front of the source. I leaks a bit, we hope it won't be too much... Use some wood piece to raise it a bit so that it is more aligned with the source.

18/02/2020
__________

* **14:53**: Removed the ferric amonium liquid sample.
* **14:53**: Starting data acquisition for Ferrous Ammonium Sulfate (oi0546)

19/02/2020
__________
* **13:41**: Removing the Ferrous Ammonium Sulfate (oi0546) sample. We will now proceed to analyze the frozen ferric amonium sample. We started by refilling the holder as it emptied a bit since monday to insure that the full window is covered (should still have same concentration).

* **13:55**: We pour liquid nitrogen in the thermos and put the sample holder in so that thermal conduction via the metal freezes the solution. We put a stirofoame cover crafted with love on top. We let the liquid freeze and add up some liquid again (its evaporating fast). Refilling the thermos with liquid nitrogen as it empties out.

* **17:04**: After many hours of adding liquid nitrogen, we finally see the peaks (but barely)!

* **17:15**: Removing frozen sample and adding the hematite sample to analyze.


21/02/2020
__________

* **13:55**: Removing the hematite sample. We want to try setting up the oven.

* **14:06**: We've changed thermocouple and placed both the sample and the thermocouple approximately at the center of the oven. Used the wood block to place the oven at the right height.

* **14:21**: Will put the sample at room temperature for the weekend and heat it up next week. We warmed up the oven a bit when figuring out how it works so we are wainting for it to cool down.

24/02/2020
__________

* **13:45**: Stopping the run for the sample at room temperature. The spectrum of the samples after we did the frozen sample seems to have a shifted center for some reasons (both the one we just removed and the hematite sample

* **14:30**: Doing a second calibration (iron) run to try to figure out the shifting problem.

* **15:20**: Iron is ok, we will start the run for YFeO3 when heated. We got a variac from Saverio so that we don't melt the sample. 

* **15:57**: Starting run for YFeO3 at 206C.


25/02/2020
__________

* **16:00**: Took the data at 208C and changed the temperature to 250C.


26/02/2020
__________

* **1:38**: Taking the data for the 250C sample and will increase temperature to 300C.
* **1:48**: Oven is ready, we're starting acquisition of data at 300C.

__________
* **10:54**: Uploaded data for 300C
